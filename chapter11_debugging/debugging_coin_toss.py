"""
The following program is meant to be a simple coin toss guessing game. The
player gets two guesses (it's an easy game). However, the program has several
bugs in it. Run through the program a few times to find the bugs that keep
the program from working correctly.
"""

""" Bugs we can find:
- The original code is not able to tell the difference between HEADS and heads
(and any other difference between using lower and upper cases in heads or tails)
- the input from the user and the result of the toss in the line `if toss == guess`
will never evaluate to True because there is nothing that converts the result 1 or 0
from the `random.randint(0,1)` to the string 'heads/tails'
- even if there were something converting the number 0 or 1 to heads or tails, in the
second `guess = input()` there is nothing checking if the input is heads or tails, thus
since it can be anything like 'heads', 'tails' or 'umbreon is the best pok√©mon' so there
can be any input to the program.
