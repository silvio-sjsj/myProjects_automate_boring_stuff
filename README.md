This repository contains my attempts at solving exercises and practice projects from the aforementioned book.

## Projects from chapter 7: Pattern matching with regular expressions

**What you'll find in the files:**
 * `regex_date_detection_test.py`: A simple test to match dates in the format DD/MM/YYYY. The code simply takes 8 predefined dates and tests if they are valid.
 * `regex_date_detection.py`: A more complete solution that takes as input everything from an internet page from the clipboard and searches for dates that match the pattern.
 * `regex_strip.py`: An exercise using regex to build a function that performs the same task as the `strip()` string method.
 * `regex_strong_password.py`: A function using regex to ensure that a password is strong, meaning it meets specific criteria (8 characters long, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one special character, and one digit).
